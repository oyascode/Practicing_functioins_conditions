# JavaScript Statements  
JavaScript statements are simply a unit of instructions that point out strictly an action that a computer should carry out. They, unlike properties, methods and events are independent of any JavaScript object. This makes them usable in windows object, document object and any other form of object.

## Examples of JavaScript Statements
Some examples of JavaScrfipt statements include:  
### Conditional Statement
  if (epression)  
      Do something  
  else  
      Do another thing  
### Declaration Statement
const jump;  
function jumpTheGun() {  
  Do something  
}  
### Loop
Do  
break dance  
while(expression)

# JavaScript Expressions
An expression in JavaScript is a unit of code that can be evaluated or resolved to a Value.

## Examples of JavaScript Expressions
Below are a few examples:  
### Primary expression
e.g True  
    "Hello World"
### Arithmetic Expression
e.g 15 + 3
### String Expression
e.g "Beautiful " + "Music"
### Logical Expression
e.g animal === "dog"

# Difference Between Statement and Expression

Programs are practically sequence of statements. Therefore, a statment can be written where an expression is expected-in this case, it will be an expression statement.

Whereas Expressions generally produce a value, they are therefore used when we expect to get a value.  As a result, an expression cannot be written when a statement is expected.


# What are JavaScript functions

Functions are a set of statement that carry out a specific task. They help us to avoid unnecessary repetition of codes as they can be used over and over again.  

For example, to "eat out" is popularly used to mean:  
1. Go to a restaurant
2. buy a meal of interest  

so we do not have to constantly say I want to go to a restaurant to eat a particular meal but can simply say I want to "eat out"
